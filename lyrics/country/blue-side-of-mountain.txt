There's a place in a piney hollow
That no one but me can find
Some Choctaw built it in the hillside
Stone by stone in a simpler time

It's a holy place my daddy showed me
Back before this land of mine
On the blue side of the mountain
Where the sun don't ever shine

So deep and dark like a hurtin' down in my heart
Maybe someday they'll show me some kind of sign
On the blue side of the mountain
Where the sun don't ever shine

I'm goin' back to a world of shadow
Gotta find some peace 'for I lose my mind
On the blue side of the mountain
Where the sun don't ever shine

So deep and dark like a hurtin' down in my heart
Maybe someday they'll show me some kind of sign
On the blue side of the mountain
Where the sun don't ever shine

Where the sun don't ever shine
