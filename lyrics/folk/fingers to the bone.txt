Fingers to the BoneBrown Bird[Verse 1]I work my fingers to the boneNot a pretty little penny have I got to showI ain't looking for muchJust a little bit of rest by the side of the roadI lift my voice to the forces aboveThe Lords of labor and the Goddess of loveAin't I been a good, hard-workingFaithful servant and son?[Pre-Chorus]Then the sky turns blackAnd it cracks with a thundering voiceWork is what you are when you're breathing in and out'Til your final breath falls to the floor[Chorus]So swing down that sledgehammer through the woodA little test of mind over flesh oughta do you goodGet up off the groundYou can lay down when the day is doneAnd on the seventh dayYou can lay in the morning sun[Verse 2]I want to make my home on a mountain highJust me and my lover and the big old skyI ain't asking for muchJust a little bit of rest before the day that I dieI lift my voice to the forces aboveThe Lords of labor and the Goddess of loveAin't I been a good, hard-workingFaithful servant and son?You might also likeA&WLana Del ReyAin't That SomeMorgan WallenCome My WayBrown Bird[Pre-Chorus]Then the sky turns blackAnd it cracks with a thundering voiceWork is what you are when you're breathing in and out'Til your final breath falls to the floor[Chorus]So swing down that sledgehammer through the woodA little test of mind over flesh oughta do you goodGet up off the groundYou can lay down when the day is doneAnd on the seventh dayYou can lay in the morning sunSo swing down that sledgehammer through the woodA little test of mind over flesh oughta do you goodGet up off the groundYou can lay down when the day is doneAnd on the seventh dayYou can lay in the morning sun
